# Genome-Wide Association Study of Coronary Artery Disease and Cardiovascular Risk Factors

Course Project for [Applied Biostatistics](http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/applied-biostatistics-MATH-493) at EPFL

Genome-wide association (GWA) analysis typically focuses on the associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and traits like major human diseases. 

In this project, a GWA analysis on coronary artery disease (CAD) is carried out following the tutorial provided by [A guide to genome-wide association analysis and post-analytic interrogation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26343929).

All data and code, as well as additional instructional resources, are publicly available through the Open Resources in Statistical Genomics project: http://www.stat-gen.org.
